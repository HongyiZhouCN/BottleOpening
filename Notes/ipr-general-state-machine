How to use the general state machine:
    the basic config file:
        defines the publishers, subscribers, services and service clients needed in the state machine.
        the configuration of moveIt and other parameters could also declared in this file.
    the basic_states file:
        declares the states shared by the sub-state-machines
    the third and the fourth file indicate the configuration of the sub-state-machines

Basic configuration:
    Publisher/Subscriber/Service/Client/Parameter

    publishers:                                         # indicate that this is a Publisher
        target_pose:                                    # register a publisher in the publisher dictionary with a string 'target_pose' as key and a publisher object as value
            topic: "topic name"
            type:{'geometry_msgs.msg': 'PoseStamped'}   # configuration to instantiate a publisher object
    
    Subscriber: almost the same with publisher
    
    Service:
        standard:                                       # indicate this configuration is about service
        name: "/arm/driver/standardBottleTrigger"       
        type: {'std_srvs.srv': 'Trigger'}
        parameter: {target_obj_frame: "bottle_cap_standard_link",
                    sub_sm: 'standard'}                 # specifies the parameter keys in the parameter dictionary and their value to update once this service is called.
